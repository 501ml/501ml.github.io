      When you go to a physical bar you have plenty of different bar options to go to.  </p>
      <p>Now that we can’t go to the bars anymore we need to come up with alternatives.</p>
      <p>
      That’s why we make a virtual bar, a bar accessible from wherever you are. </p>
      <p> Our bars are the digital layer on a physical place, you can only access the bar online but they do exist as a real place in the real world. </p>
      <p> In the physical world the bar you choose to go to will depend on your personal preferences. To know what bar fits for you, you need to answer a few questions about your personal preferences before entering one of our bars. </p>
      <p>The virtuality of our bar gives us the opportunity to adapt the bar’s appearance to everyone’s personal preference. </p>
